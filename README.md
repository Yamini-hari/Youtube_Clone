I have designed a simple and effective Educational Video Streaming Platform named 'ALPHONSO' which accentuates only on Educational Videos that are streamlined to only 5th semester Engineering topics. The aim of this project is to provide easy access to Educational content and avoid unnecessary distractions while learning. It is very useful to peers as the platform is inclusive of all the subject videos related to 5th semester engineering. We have developed a platform where the accessing and streaming the videos is very simple. We have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end and customized JS framework to create the project. For the database part, we have made use of Apache Server and MySQL with PHP-myAdmin in the application XAMPP. Overall, we have attempted to create a simple and efficient way of accessing Educational content ad free.
